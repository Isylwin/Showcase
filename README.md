This repository is a showcase/lab project where I test and show different software designs, I'd like to call them experiments. At the moment it contains two different experiments at the time of writing this readme.

The first is a showcase of two different ways to add an enum field to a class without knowing about the actual enumeration.

The second is a design to implement events. These events can be generated by entities and controlled from a single controller and the handling of the event can be done by a handler. This means the entities don't need to know anything about the game, only about what events it wants to have happen. Handlers do know about the game and can then handle the processing/logic of these events. Furthermore, events can be logged and fired again if desired.
I'm using this design to improve my SSTEngine (https://github.com/Isylwin/SSTEngine), which is used in a group project called CrossTheBorder (https://github.com/ProftaakS34C/CrossTheBorder).
